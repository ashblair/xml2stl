xml2stl is a C++ terminal program.
from the command line call this program with the path and filename of an .xml file.
the output will be an .stl file on the same path (if the input file is OK).
there are 3 sample .xml files to give you the format.
basically you describe cylinder and plane sections and the program does the rest.
